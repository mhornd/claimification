# Adapting Content for Target Audiences

Make text work for the people who actually need to read it.

## Overview

Executives need different language than developers. End users need different examples than engineers. Clients need different framing than internal teams.

You're a translator between worlds, not a content creator. Take what's there and reshape it. Don't invent new content. Don't change facts. Just make it land with the right audience.

## When to Use

Use when text is written for the wrong audience:
- Technical docs that need to reach executives
- Marketing copy that needs to convince developers
- Internal content going to clients
- Expert content going to beginners
- Generic content that needs domain-specific language

Don't use when:
- The audience is already right
- You need to create new content (this adapts existing text)

## The Process

**First, figure out the gap:**
- Who's this written for now? (Spot the implicit audience)
- Who SHOULD read it? (If not specified, ask)
- What's their expertise level? Their role? What do they need to do with this?

**Then, pick your battles:**
Ask which dimensions need fixing:

1. **Terminology:** Explain jargon or use it freely?
2. **Tone:** More formal or more casual?
3. **Focus:** Features vs. benefits vs. ROI vs. technical depth?
4. **Context:** Are they evaluating, implementing, using, or deciding?

Don't change everything. Change what matters for THIS audience.

**Now, transform systematically:**
- Swap terminology (acronyms explained vs. assumed)
- Replace examples (code samples → business scenarios, or vice versa)
- Shift emphasis (how it works → what it enables)
- Reorder if needed (execs want summary first, engineers want details first)
- Keep facts intact - never invent new information

**Finally, verify:**
- All key information still there?
- Terminology consistent throughout?
- Focus matches audience priorities?
- Show adapted text + brief summary of what changed

## Common Translation Patterns

**Developer → Executive**
Keep technical terms, add business impact.
"Microservices architecture" → "Microservices architecture enables faster feature releases and reduces downtime risk"
Shift: How it works → What it enables + ROI/risk

**Technical → End User**
Kill the jargon. Focus on what they can do.
"REST API integration" → "automatically connects with your existing tools"
Shift: Implementation → Capabilities in plain language

**Generic → Domain-Specific**
Add their language, their metrics, their tools.
"Improve efficiency" → "reduce ticket resolution time by 40%"
Shift: Vague benefits → Concrete domain outcomes

**Internal → External**
Make the implicit explicit. Remove insider language.
"Push to PROD after QA signoff" → "Deploy to production after quality assurance approval"
Shift: Assumed context → Explained process

## Multiple Audiences

Need versions for executives AND developers AND end users?

Do them one at a time. Keep your core analysis. Show side-by-side comparison at the end. Highlight where they differ most.

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Keep all facts and core messages intact
- Stay consistent (explain acronym once = explain it throughout)
- Shift emphasis to match audience priorities
- Remove details that don't matter to this audience
- Make implicit context explicit for external audiences
- Ask which dimension matters most when unsure

**DON'T:**
- Invent new examples or content
- Change facts or create new information
- Mix terminology styles (pick one and stick to it)
- Add jargon when simplifying for non-experts
- Over-explain to experts
- Assume internal context for external readers

## Key Principles

- **Facts are sacred** - Never change them
- **Audience priorities drive everything** - What matters to them = what you emphasize
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Cut details they don't need
- **Consistency over variety** - If you explain it once, keep explaining it
- **Explicit beats implicit** - Especially for external audiences
- **One battle at a time** - Focus on the dimension that matters most

## Remember

You're translating, not creating. The content exists—your job is to make it work for different readers. An executive and a developer can both understand the same system, they just need different language to get there.

Don't overthink it. Ask yourself: "What does THIS audience care about?" Then emphasize that. Cut what they don't need. Explain what they don't know. Keep what they need to decide or act.
